Based of the FAME Community module [cuckoo-modified](https://github.com/certsocietegenerale/fame_modules/tree/master/processing/cuckoo_modified)
This module submits the file to Cuckoo Sandbox and retrieves results (report and memory dump).

It is only compatible with the [spender-sandbox/cuckoo-modified](https://github.com/spender-sandbox/cuckoo-modified) fork.
